title: Limit the rate of messages passing through a flow
---

### Problem

You want to limit the rate of messages to, let's say, one message per second.

### Solution

Use a <code class="node">Delay</code> node configured with action = rate limit.

#### Example

![](/images/basic/basic-flow-012.png)

{% raw %}
~~~json

### Discussion

You can allow messages to be dropped by checking, in the node configuration dialog, the box named drop intermediate messages.
